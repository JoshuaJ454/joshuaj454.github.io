     <p> Hey there! I'm Joshua Johnson <i class="italics">(producer name: Joshua J)</i> and I've been making music for almost 4 years straight now. </p>
     <p> My start in music making wasn't like everyone else's, then again we all have different stories... </p>
     <br>
     </br>
     <h2> The Beginning </h2>
     <p> The first time I ever made a track was in <b id="bold">2015</b> on <i class="italics">Garageband</i>. It wasn't very good because I did not know what I was doing at the time. As time progressed, I started learning more and more. 
       <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/Thank_U%2C_Next_album_cover.png/220px-Thank_U%2C_Next_album_cover.png" class="center">
  <p> I began learning how to use <b id="bold">sample loops</b> and manipulated them to make them sound unique.
    <p> Once the 2018-2019 school year came around, I started learning how to make my own drum sequences after listening to the sample loops I had and other songs. One day, a <i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7XHduHsBvk">certain song</a></i> by <b id="bold">Ariana Grande</b> lit a spark inside of me. </p>
  <p> It was from this point on I started to take making music a little more <b id="bold">seriously</b> instead of just a side hobby I do for an hour to distract myself. </p>
   <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d5/Mjtdcau.jpg" class="center">
  <p> After learning how to setup drum sequences, I started learning <b id="bold">chord progressions</b> from looking at piano tutorials of some of my favorite songs. This one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVoCY-0TqSE">piano tutorial</a> of <i class="italics">They Don't Really Care About Us</i> by <b id="bold">Micheal Jackson</b> took me in a direction I never expected... </p>
  <br>
  </br>
  <h2> Taking The Next Step </h2>
<p> Once I learned the chords for <i class="italics">They Don't Really Care About Us</i>, I took a leap of faith and decided to sample the chord progression and drum sequence to create my own version of the song. After the main production was done, I thought it still wasn't enough to be a <b>strong</b> track. </p> 
 <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/bwxjXRZYJcY/maxresdefault.jpg" class="center">
<p> So I took another leap of faith and sampled a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwxjXRZYJcY">live performance</a> of the poem <i class="italics">All Lives Matter, But...</i> by <b id="bold">Royce Mann</b> on the talk show <i class="italics">The Preachers.</i> However, the track still wasn't strong enough. </p>
    <p> Finally, I went back to <i class="italics">They Don't Really Care About Us</i>, and sampled part of the song where children are singing the chorus and put it in the <b id="bold">hook</b> of my track. I also sampled Jackson's actual vocals for the <b id="bold">outro.</b> </p>
<p> After all that, the track was complete, but I didn't have a name. Fortunately, I came up with <i class="italics">They Don't Care</i>, since I sampled <i class="italics">They Don't Really Care About Us</i> and created <a href= "https://soundcloud.com/dj-jj-397313117/they-dont-care">this</a>. </P>
<br>     
</br>
<h3> After making <i>They Don't Care</i>, I decided to take music a little more serious and started the process of making first project... </h3>
<br>
</br>
<h2> Sub-Zero </h2>
<p> The process began kind of rocky as I rushed into doing it. I got so excited from making <i class="italics">They Don't Care</i> that I made mediocre tracks. I took a small break and started doubting myself, thinking this project would not work out. </p>
 <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cc/64/18/cc64180e6bacf4c1a828847e0cd06f5f.jpg" class="center">
<p> However, a regular Saturday of me in my room playing <i class="italics"><b>Mortal Kombat 11</b></i>, changed everything. I was instantly inspired by the music playing in each stage and got straight to work. This time, before making the music, I tried thinking of the name of the track first. It took only a few seconds for the name <a href="https://soundcloud.com/dj-jj-397313117/sub-0">"Sub-0"</a> to come my head, and I rolled with it. </p>
<p> I made the track in the matter of 2 hours, sampled a dialogue between <i>Sub-Zero</i> and <i>Scorpion</i>, added my producer tag, and the lead single to the project was complete. </p>
<p> In my head I knew the project was going to be called "Sub-Zero" as well. The only thing I was uneasy about was releasing any singles. The traditional way that artists title their albums and other projects is from their lead single. For example, Ariana Grande's lead single for her recent album was positions, which was also the title of the album she released shortly after. Other singles are either released prior to the album release, or they are singles shortly after release dates. </p>
<p> I decided to take a chance and not release any singles. I just made <b id="bold">11 tracks</b> over the course of a month and a half, and called it a day. My goal was to make <b id="bold">4 tracks,</b> but unfortunately down to my last three I lost motivation again. </p>

<p> For the next two weeks, I decided to take another break. During that break, <b id="bold">Lady Gaga</b> released her highly anticipated album, <i class="italics"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1cnWzwoK7Q&list=PL9K4gwmvtl1jSO34-fPWmq5OT7Soicmjj">Chromatica</a></i>, and I was instantly inspired once again. Three tracks in particular that piqued my interest were <i class="italics">Chromatica I, Chromatica II,</i> and <i class="italics">Chromatica III.</i> These three tracks weren't regular songs like the other 13 on <i class="italics">Chromatica</i>, they were transitions. When hearing them my first listen, I knew this is what I needed to finish Sub-Zero. With the inspiration from <i class="italics">Chromatica</i>, I made my own three transitions and titled them "Round 1, Round 2, and Round 3", to keep the consistent <i>Mortal Kombat</i>-like theme.</p>
<p> Once the transitions, were added the tracklist looked like this in the end...</p>
